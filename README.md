# Unity3DPlatformer

First Unity game based of tutorials found on internet.

## The project

The project is to do a character movements controller with most options availables normally in 3D / 2D platformer games.
For every movement I will do the code to switch the animation and will do the movement physic behind.

I will also do the map, the 3rd person camera and a hierarchical state machine to switch current movement state.

### Currently implemented

-   Hierarchical State Machine pattern
-   Walk / Run
-   Single jump
-   Triple jump

### Movements to be implemented

-   3rd person camera
-   Wall jump
-   Dash
-   Spin jump
-   Dive
-   Telegraphed jump
-   Object grab
